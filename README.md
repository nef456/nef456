# About me ðŸ¤™

 Hey everyone! My name is Nick. I am currently enrolled in software development classes, and I would like to start creating projects to help me learn, as well as potentially break into the software development workforce. 

- I have worked on some small projects for class using Java, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Python, SQL, MySQL.
- I am currently working on mobile applications using React.
- I enjoy most all sports, and riding my motorcycle in my free time.
- I would like to broaden my development knowledge as well as my development network by creating new relationships with like minded people!
